# CSAFlappyPig
1. Project Title: Flappy Pig

2. Project Issue / Problem to Be Solved

•Problem: To create an engaging, beginner-friendly game that teaches fundamental programming concepts (like object-oriented design, sprite manipulation, and collision detection) while offering an entertaining user experience.

•Solution: Develop a game inspired by Flappy Bird that uses a unique theme and provides opportunities for hands-on learning in Python and game development using Pygame.

3. Current Progress (PDLC Stages)

1. Problem Analysis:

•Users need a lightweight, interactive game for casual gameplay and programming education.

2. Design:

•The game features a “pig” character navigating through obstacles (pipes made of bacon).

•Graphics, animation, and mechanics are carefully designed to be intuitive and visually appealing.

3. Development:

•Implemented core gameplay (jump, score system, collision detection).

•Added animations, gravity, and a restart button for usability.

4. Testing:

•Currently testing gameplay mechanics for smooth performance and bug-free interaction.

4. Project Features/Functions

•Gameplay Mechanics:

•Navigate the pig through pipes by pressing the mouse button.

•Gravity-based movement and collision detection.

•Restart functionality via an on-screen button.

•Score System:

•Tracks the player’s score based on successfully passing pipes.

•Graphics and Animation:

•Animated pig with a flap effect.

•Dynamic background and ground scrolling.

•Game Over Handling:

•Stops gameplay and shows a restart button when conditions are met.

5. Expected No. of Pages

•Expected Screens/Pages:

1. Game Screen: Gameplay interface with the pig, pipes, ground, and score display.

2. Game Over Screen: Displays score and restart button.

6. Database Applied

•Database Usage:

•Currently, there is no database integration. Future improvements could include saving high scores locally or in an online database.
